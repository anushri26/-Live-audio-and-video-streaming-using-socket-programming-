# Live Audio and Video Streaming Using Socket Programming

Audio and video streaming using socket programming involves transmitting audio and video data over a network using sockets. Below is a high-level overview of the process:

## Process Overview

### 1. Setting Up the Server

- **Create a Socket**: The server creates a socket using the appropriate protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP).
- **Bind to a Port**: The socket is bound to a specific port number.
- **Listen for Connections**: The server listens for incoming client connections.

### 2. Setting Up the Client

- **Connect to the Server**: The client connects to the server using the server's IP address and port number.
- **Create a Socket**: The client creates a socket to communicate with the server.

### 3. Sending Data

- **Stream Data**: Once connected, the server starts sending audio and video data to the client.
- **Data Chunks**: The data is sent in chunks to handle large data efficiently.

### 4. Receiving Data

- **Read Data**: The client receives the audio and video data from the server.
- **Play Data**: The client reads the data in chunks and plays it back.
- **Buffering**: Proper buffering is required to avoid playback issues.

### 5. Closing the Connection

- **Complete Streaming**: Once the streaming is complete, the connection is closed.
- **Disconnect**: Either the client or server can close the connection.

## Summary

By following these steps, you can implement audio and video streaming using socket programming, handling the transmission and reception of media data effectively.
